            Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the
            Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web
            development can range from developing a simple single static page of
            plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and
            social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which
            Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web
            design, Web content development, client liaison,
            client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security
            configuration, and e-commerce development. Among Web professionals,
            "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of
            building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development
            may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes
            easier and available with basic technical skills. For larger
            organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of
            hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like
            Agile methodologies while developing Web sites.[1] Smaller
            organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting
            developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as
            a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web
            development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather
            than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of
            Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end
            developer, and full-stack developer.[3] Front-end developers are
            responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser,
            while back-end developers deal with the servers.[4] Since the
            commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become
            one of the most used technologies ever.

            Debra Howcraft and John Carroll proposed a methodology in which web
            development process can be divided into sequential steps. They
            mentioned different aspects of analysis.[17] Phase one involves
            crafting a web strategy and analyzing how a website can effectively
            achieve its goals. Keil et al.'s research[18] identifies the primary
            reasons for software project failures as a lack of top management
            commitment and misunderstandings of system requirements. To mitigate
            these risks, Phase One establishes strategic goals and objectives,
            designing a system to fulfill them. The decision to establish a web
            presence should ideally align with the organization's corporate
            information strategy. The analysis phase can be divided into 3
            steps: Development of a web strategy Defining objectives Objective
            analysis During this phase, the previously outlined objectives and
            available resources undergo analysis to determine their feasibility.
            This analysis is divided into six tasks, as follows: Technology
            analysis: Identification of all necessary technological components
            and tools for constructing, hosting, and supporting the site.
            Information analysis: Identification of user-required information,
            whether static (web page) or dynamic (pulled "live" from a database
            server). Skills analysis: Identification of the diverse skill sets
            necessary to complete the project. User analysis: Identification of
            all intended users of the site, a more intricate process due to the
            varied range of users and technologies they may use. Cost analysis:
            Estimation of the development cost for the site or an evaluation of
            what is achievable within a predefined budget. Risk analysis:
            Examination of any major risks associated with site development.
            Following this analysis, a more refined set of objectives is
            documented. Objectives that cannot be presently fulfilled are
            recorded in a Wish List, constituting part of the Objectives
            Document. This documentation becomes integral to the iterative
            process during the subsequent cycle of the methodology.[17]
            Planning: sitemap and wireframe It is crucial for web developers to
            be engaged in formulating a plan and determining the optimal
            architecture and selecting the frameworks.[citation needed]
            Additionally, developers/consultants play a role in elucidating the
            total cost of ownership associated with supporting a website, which
            may surpass the initial development expenses. Key aspects in this
            step are: Sitemap creation Wireframe creation Tech stack Design and
            layout Following the analysis phase, the development process moves
            on to the design phase, which is guided by the objectives document.
            Recognizing the incremental growth of websites and the potential
            lack of good design architecture, the methodology includes iteration
            to account for changes and additions over the life of the site. The
            design phase, which is divided into Information Design and Graphic
            Design, results in a detailed Design Document that details the
            structure of the website, database data structures, and CGI
            scripts.* The following step, design testing, focuses on early,
            low-cost testing to identify inconsistencies or flaws in the design.
            This entails comparing the website's design to the goals and
            objectives outlined in the first three steps. Phases One and Two
            involve an iterative loop in which objectives in the Objectives
            Document are revisited to ensure alignment with the design. Any
            objectives that are removed are added to the Wish List for future
            consideration.[17]
