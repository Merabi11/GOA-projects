              Web development is the work involved in developing a website for
              the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private
              network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple
              single static page of plain text to complex web applications,
              electronic businesses, and social network services. A more
              comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly
              refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content
              development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting,
              Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce
              development. Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually
              refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites:
              writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content
              management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and
              available with basic technical skills. For larger organizations
              and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of
              people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile
              methodologies while developing Web sites.[1] Smaller organizations
              may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or
              secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic
              designer or information systems technician. Web development may be
              a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain
              of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer
              specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and
              full-stack developer.[3] Front-end developers are responsible for
              behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end
              developers deal with the servers.[4] Since the commercialization
              of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most
              used technologies ever.
