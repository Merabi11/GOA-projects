      Facebook is a social networking site owned by Meta Platforms.[2] Users can
      add friends and send messages, and create and update personal profiles.
      Users can also join the network based on their city, workplace, school, or
      region. Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg with his college friends
      and computer science students Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris
      Haggis while they were students at Harvard University.[3]

    <h2>Mark Zuckerberg</h2>
    <p>
      The history of Facebook traces its growth from a college networking site
      to a global social networking service.[15] While attending Phillips Exeter
      in the early 2000's, Zuckerberg met Kris Tillery. Tillery, a one-time
      project collaborator with Zuckerberg, would create a school-based social
      networking project called Photo Address Book. Photo Address Book was a
      digital face book, created through a linked database composed of student
      information derived from the official records of the Exeter student
      council. The database contained linkages such as name, dorm-specific
      landline numbers, and student headshots.[16] Mark Zuckerberg built a
      website called "Facemash" in 2003 while attending Harvard University. The
      site was comparable to Hot or Not and used photos from online face books,
      asking users to choose the 'hotter' person".[17] Zuckerberg was reported
      and faced expulsion, but the charges were dropped.[17] A "face book" is a
      student directory featuring photos and personal information. In January
      2004, Zuckerberg coded a new site known as "TheFacebook", stating, "It is
      clear that the technology needed to create a centralized Website is
      readily available ... the benefits are many." Zuckerberg met with Harvard
      student Eduardo Saverin, and each agreed to invest $1,000.[18] On February
      4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "TheFacebook".[19]

      Membership was initially restricted to students of Harvard College. Dustin
      Moskovitz, Andrew McCollum, and Chris Hughes joined Zuckerberg to help
      manage the growth of the site.[20] It became available successively to
      most universities in the US and Canada.[21][22] In 2004, Napster
      co-founder Sean Parker became company president[23] and the company moved
      to Palo Alto, California.[24] PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel gave Facebook
      its first investment.[25][26] In 2005, the company dropped "the" from its
      name after purchasing the domain name Facebook.com.[27] In 2006, Facebook
      opened to everyone at least 13 years old with a valid email
      address.[28][29][30] Facebook introduced key features like the News Feed,
      which became central to user engagement. By late 2007, Facebook had
      100,000 pages on which companies promoted themselves.[31] Facebook had
      surpassed MySpace in global traffic and became the world's most popular
      social media platform. Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 1.6%
      share of Facebook for $240 million ($364 million in 2024 dollars[32]),
      giving Facebook an implied value of around $15 billion ($22.7 billion in
      2024 dollars[32]). Facebook focused on generating revenue through targeted
      advertising based on user data, a model that drove its rapid financial
      growth. In 2012, Facebook went public with one of the largest IPOs in tech
      history. Acquisitions played a significant role in Facebook's dominance.
      In 2012, it purchased Instagram, followed by WhatsApp and Oculus VR in
      2014, extending its influence beyond social networking into messaging and
      virtual reality. Mark Zuckerberg announces $60 billion investment in Meta
      AI according to Mashable.

        >The Facebookâ€“Cambridge Analytica data scandal in 2018 revealed misuse
        of user data to influence elections, sparking global outcry and leading
        to regulatory fines and hearings. Facebook's role in global events,
        including its use in organizing movements like the Arab Spring and its
        impact on events like the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar, highlighted its
        dual nature as a tool for empowerment and harm. In 2021, Facebook
        rebranded as Meta, reflecting its shift toward building the "metaverse"
        and focusing on virtual reality and augmented reality technologies.

    <h2>Facebook</h2>
    <p>
      Facebook is a social media and social networking service owned by the
      American technology conglomerate Meta. Created in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg
      with four other Harvard College students and roommates, Eduardo Saverin,
      Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name derives from
      the face book directories often given to American university students.
      Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding
      to other North American universities. Since 2006, Facebook allows everyone
      to register from 13 years old, except in the case of a handful of nations,
      where the age requirement is 14 years.[6] As of December 2023, Facebook
      claimed almost 3.07 billion monthly active users worldwide.[7] As of
      November 2024, Facebook ranked as the third-most-visited website in the
      world, with 23% of its traffic coming from the United States.[8] It was
      the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.[9]
    </p>
    <p>
      Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as
      personal computers, tablets and smartphones. After registering, users can
      create a profile revealing personal information about themselves. They can
      post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who
      have agreed to be their friend or, with different privacy settings,
      publicly. Users can also communicate directly with each other with
      Messenger, edit messages (within 15 minutes after sending),[10][11] join
      common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the activities of
      their Facebook friends and the pages they follow.

        >Facebook has often been criticized over issues such as user privacy (as
        with the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal), political
        manipulation (as with the 2016 U.S. elections) and mass
        surveillance.[12] The company has also been subject to criticism over
        its psychological effects such as addiction and low self-esteem, and
        over content such as fake news, conspiracy theories, copyright
        infringement, and hate speech.[13] Commentators have accused Facebook of
        willingly facilitating the spread of such content, as well as
        exaggerating its number of users to appeal to advertisers.[14]</strong
