    <h2>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</h2>
    <p>
      Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
      content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies
      such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
      JavaScript, a programming language. Web browsers receive HTML documents
      from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
      multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page
      semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
      images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into
      the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
      denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
      lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by
      tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly
      introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p and p surround and
      provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags.
      Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the
      content of the page. HTML can embed programs written in a scripting
      language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web
      pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The
      World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current
      maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over
      explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[3] A form of HTML, known as
      HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the canvas
      element, together with JavaScript.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
      prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share
      documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
      hypertext system.[4] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and
      server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems
      engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but
      the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of
      1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is
      used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[5] The first publicly available
      description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[6] first mentioned
      on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[7][8] It describes 18
      elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except
      for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by CERN SGML, an
      in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation
      format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[9] HTML is
      a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text,
      images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default
      characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser,
      and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page
      designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned
      in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which
      describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that
      used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS
      (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting
      commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually
      format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based
      on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely
      print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been
      progressively moved in this direction with CSS.

    <h2>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h2>
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying
      the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language
      such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
      XHTML).[2] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
      alongside HTML and JavaScript.[3] CSS is designed to enable the separation
      of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[4] This
      separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be
      written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and
      control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable
      multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
      separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
      structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the
      page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the
      same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such
      as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen
      reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for
      alternative formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[5]
      The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine
      which declaration applies if more than one declaration of a property match
      a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The
      CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
      Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by
      RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for
      CSS documents.[6] In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the
      use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in
      the GTK widget toolkit.

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/ ⓘ), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming
      language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
      CSS. Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
      webpage behavior.[10] Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that
      executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers
      and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser
      usage is Node.js.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time–compiled language that
      conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing,
      prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
      multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
      programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
      working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
      and the Document Object Model (DOM). The ECMAScript standard does not
      include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
      facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides
      JavaScript APIs for I/O. Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name
      and syntax, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
    </p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      Creation at Netscape The first popular web browser with a graphical user
      interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. The lead developers of Mosaic
      then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished
      browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the
      most-used.[12] During these formative years of the Web, web pages could
      only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page
      was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web
      development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided
      to add a programming language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to
      achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java
      language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6]
      The goal was a "language for the masses",[13] "to help nonprogrammers
      create dynamic, interactive Web sites".[14] Netscape management soon
      decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with
      syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting
      languages.[5][6] Although the new language and its interpreter
      implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a
      Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for
      the official release in December.[6][1][15][16] The choice of the
      JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related
      to Java. At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was a popular
      new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by
      Netscape.

    <h2>React (React.js)</h2>
    <p>
      React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source
      front-end JavaScript library[5][6] that aims to make building user
      interfaces based on components more "seamless".[5] It is maintained by
      Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and
      companies.[7][8][9]
    </p>
    <p>
      React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered
      applications with frameworks like Next.js and Remix[a]. Because React is
      only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the
      DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other
      client-side functionality.[11][12] A key advantage of React is that it
      only re-renders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding
      unnecessary re-rendering of unchanged DOM elements. [13] React adheres to
      the declarative programming paradigm.[14]: 76  Developers design views for
      each state of an application, and React updates and renders components
      when data changes. This is in contrast with imperative programming.[15]
    </p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Meta, who
      initially developed a prototype called "F-Bolt"[55] before later renaming
      it to "FaxJS". This early version is documented in Jordan Walke's GitHub
      repository.[1] Influences for the project included XHP, an HTML component
      library for PHP. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011
      and subsequently integrated into Instagram in 2012.[56] In May 2013, at
      JSConf US, the project was officially open-sourced, marking a significant
      turning point in its adoption and growth.[2] React Native, which enables
      native Android, iOS, and UWP development with React, was announced at
      Facebook's React Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in March 2015. On
      April 18, 2017, Facebook announced React Fiber, a new set of internal
      algorithms for rendering, as opposed to React's old rendering algorithm,
      Stack.[57] React Fiber was to become the foundation of any future
      improvements and feature development of the React library.[58][needs
      update] The actual syntax for programming with React does not change; only
      the way that the syntax is executed has changed.[59] React's old rendering
      system, Stack, was developed at a time when the focus of the system on
      dynamic change was not understood. Stack was slow to draw complex
      animation, for example, trying to accomplish all of it in one chunk. Fiber
      breaks down animation into segments that can be spread out over multiple
      frames. Likewise, the structure of a page can be broken into segments that
      may be maintained and updated separately. JavaScript functions and virtual
      DOM objects are called "fibers", and each can be operated and updated
      separately, allowing for smoother on-screen rendering.[60] On September
      26, 2017, React 16.0 was released to the public.[61] On October 20, 2020,
      the React team released React v17.0, notable as the first major release
      without major changes to the React developer-facing API.[62] On March 29,
      2022, React 18 was released which introduced a new concurrent renderer,
      automatic batching and support for server side rendering with
      Suspense.[63] On December 5, 2024, React 19 was released. This release
      introduced Actions, which simplify the process of making state updates
      using asynchronous functions rather than having to manually handle pending
      states, errors and optimistic updates. React 19 also included support for
      server components and improved static site generation.[64] Version history

    <h2>Node (Node.js)</h2>
    <p>
      Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment
      that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the
      V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
      Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for
      server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is
      often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to
      the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript
      everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a
      single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for
      the server- versus client-side programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O.
      These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web
      applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time
      Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser
      games).[7] The Node.js distributed development project was previously
      governed by the Node.js Foundation,[8] and has now merged with the JS
      Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation. OpenJS Foundation is facilitated
      by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.[9]
    </p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      Node.js was initially written by Ryan Dahl in 2009,[10] about 13 years
      after the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment,
      Netscape's LiveWire Pro Web.[11] The initial release supported only Linux
      and Mac OS X. Its development and maintenance was led by Dahl and later
      sponsored by Joyent.[12] Dahl criticized the limited capability of Apache
      HTTP Server to handle many (10,000+) concurrent connections, as well as
      the dominant programming paradigm of sequential programming, in which
      applications could block entire processes or cause the creation of
      multiple execution stacks for simultaneous connections.[13] Dahl
      demonstrated the project at the inaugural European JSConf on November 8,
      2009.[14][15][16] Node.js combined Google's V8 JavaScript engine, an event
      loop, and a low-level I/O API.[17] In January 2010, a package manager was
      introduced for the Node.js environment called npm.[18] The package manager
      allows programmers to publish and share Node.js packages, along with the
      accompanying source code, and is designed to simplify the installation,
      update and uninstallation of packages.[17] In June 2011, Microsoft and
      Joyent implemented a native Windows version of Node.js.[19] The first
      Node.js build supporting Windows was released in July 2011. In January
      2012, Dahl yielded management of the project to npm creator Isaac
      Schlueter.[20] In January 2014, Schlueter announced that Timothy J.
      Fontaine would lead the project.[21] In December 2014, Fedor Indutny
      created io.js, a fork of Node.js created because of dissatisfaction with
      Joyent's governance as an open-governance alternative with a separate
      technical committee. The goal was to enable a structure that would be more
      receptive to community input, including the updating of io.js with the
      latest Google V8 JavaScript engine releases, diverging from Node.js's
      approach at that time.[22] The Node.js Foundation, formed to reconcile
      Node.js and io.js under a unified banner, was announced in February
      2015.[23] The merger was realized in September 2015 with Node.js v0.12 and
      io.js v3.3 combining into Node v4.0.[24] This merge brought V8 ES6
      features into Node.js and started a long-term support release cycle.[25]
      By 2016, the io.js website recommended returning to Node.js and announced
