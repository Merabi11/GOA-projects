              Basta's father was an army officer who served in the Armed Forces
              of Belarus (formerly part of Soviet Union) during the 1980s.[2]
              Basta studied at a local music college but did not graduate. Basta
              first began to write rap songs around the age of 15–16. In 1997,
              he joined the rap group Psycholyric, which he later renamed to
              Kasta. In 1998, he recorded his first solo single "Моя Игра" (Moya
              Igra/My Game). Subsequently, Basta assembled his own band,
              "Уличные Звуки" (Ulichnye Zvuki/Street Sounds). In 2004, he was
              noticed by Bogdan Titomir, who invited him to accompany him to
              Moscow. In Moscow, Basta met other performers Smoky Mo and Guf
              (future founder of Centr). Later, he participated in recording
              Guf's album "Город дорог" (Gorod Dorog/City of Roads) and
              collaborated with him on the cover of his first single "Моя Игра"
              (Moya Igra/My Game). In 2008, Basta adopted the stage name
              "Noggano", an allusion to the Nagant M1895 revolver. He recorded
              two albums "Ноггано первый" (Noggano: The First) and "Ноггано
              теплый" (Noggano Warm). After his "Noggano" project, he rebranded
              himself as a Gangsta rapper, calling "Noggano" his alter ego.
              Basta and his business partner, Evgeny Antimoniy, founded the
              Gazgolder company in 2006. The company have a multi-brand strategy
              and, under their ownership, it acts as a music record label,
              nightclub, production company, management agency, and talent
              agency. Under Gazgolder, they also own multiple stores which
              include clothes shops, pubs, restaurants, vape shops, and a
              jewelry retailer. In October 2019, he became the owner of the FC
              SKA Rostov-on-Don.[3][4] Together with the company "Rostec", they
              participated in the restoration of the club[5][6][7]
